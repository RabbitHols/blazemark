The markdown parse is moved on a separate thread, without polluting the main thread, that\'s allow the user to write without beeing blocked from the markdown parser.\n\nThe parse under the hood is done with [md4c](https://github.com/mity/md4c)\n\nThe editor is [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/), While writing inside the editor, a webworker run the wasm module, so the main thread is never polluted allowing the user to write without waiting the markdown parse to finish.\n\nYou can benchmark it with your favorite web markdown editor, by pasting huge text:\n\n- [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/)\n- [Editor.MD](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html)\n- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)\n\n\n\n#### TODO:\n- I should pass to the md4c only the visible markdown element in the viewport, doesn\'t make sense to render all the document.\n\n\n# CHANGELOG\n\n- 0.0.1 - A little compromise was made by downgrading the performance. Now the app convert the html to react component. This Was made to avoid reloading the entire html element when writing on large chunk of text and to remove innerHTML.\n\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n\n# Here below a big markdown text to play with it \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nAn h1 header\n============\n\nParagraphs are separated by a blank line.\n\n2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and monospace.

Here\'s a footnote [^1].\n\n[^1]: Some footnote text.\n\nTables can look like this:\n\nName           Size  Material      Color\n------------- -----  ------------  ------------\nAll Business      9  leather       brown\nRoundabout       10  hemp canvas   natural\nCinderella       11  glass         transparent\n\nTable: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors.\n\n(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports\nmulti-line tables:\n\n--------  -----------------------\nKeyword   Text\n--------  -----------------------\nred       Sunsets, apples, and\n          other red or reddish\n          things.\n\ngreen     Leaves, grass, frogs\n          and other things it\'s\n          not easy being.\n--------  -----------------------\n\nA horizontal rule follows.\n\n***\n\nHere\'s a definition list:\n\napples\n  : Good for making applesauce.\n\noranges\n  : Citrus!\n\ntomatoes\n  : There\'s no "e" in tomatoe.\n\nAgain, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each\nterm and  its definition to spread things out more.)\n\nHere\'s a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):\n\n| Line one\n|   Line too\n| Line tree\n\nand images can be specified like so:\n\n![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")\n\nInline math equation: $omega = dphi / dt$. Display\nmath should get its own line like so:\n\n$$I = int \nho R^{2} dV$$\n\nAnd note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters\nwhich you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \foo, *bar*, etc.An h1 header\n============\n\nParagraphs are separated by a blank line.\n\n2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and monospace. Itemized lists\nlook like:\n\n  * this one\n  * that one\n  * the other one\n\nNote that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text\ncontent starts at 4-columns in.\n\n> Block quotes are\n> written like so.\n>\n> They can span multiple paragraphs,\n> if you like.\n\nUse 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it\'s all\nin chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.\nUnicode is supported. \u263a\n\n\n\nAn h2 header\n------------\n\nHere\'s a numbered list:\n\n 1. first item\n 2. second item\n 3. third item\n\nNote again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters\nfrom the left side). Here\'s a code sample:\n\n    # Let me re-iterate ...\n    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }\n\nAs you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\n\n~~~\ndefine foobar() {\n    print "Welcome to flavor country!";\n}\n~~~\n\n(which makes copying & pasting easier).
